# entertainME

A MERN Stack Web Application

Created as Project 3 during DU Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a full-stack MERN web application that utilizes React(including JSX and CSS for a polished interface), MongoDB for database calls to get, pull and push data, Express for routing/API calls, and Node.js for back-end.

## User Story

- AS A fan of all things entertainment,
- I WANT a centralized location where I can go to learn about upcoming movies & TV Shows, search for some of my favorite classics and learn more about my favorite celebrities
- SO THAT I can keep track of new movie/tv show releases and celebrity appearances/information, with the ability to share with friends & family.

## Overview
